<h3>Welcome to my corner of the Internet!</h3>

<span>
    I'm Pyx but some people may know me as darkpixlz. I'm a programmer (with about <strong>8</strong> years
    of experience), UI/UX designer, music enjoyer, HiFi addict, furry, privacy enthusiast, a slightly retired gamer, and more.

    I am proficient programming in <lua class="nerdfont"> Luau</lua>, <python class="nerdfont"> Python</python> (certified too!), <webdev class="nerdfont"> 󰟬 HTML + SASS</webdev>, and <ts
        class="nerdfont"> TypeScript.</ts> Eventually I want to learn Rust and I'm learning a little bit of QML on the side. For more information, see the Projects page. <br> <br>

    I have loved computers and everything to do with them since I was a young kid. Building them, debugging Nvidia drivers on Arch, tinkering, and more, which led me to programming at a young age
    using Roblox Studio, which is why I have known Luau the longest. It's still my best language to date due to its simplicity. <br> <br>

    I use <arch class="nerdfont">󰣇 Arch</arch> btw with <de class="nerdfont"> Hyprland</de> on my desktop at the moment with a forked shell, however my servers run a mix of Arch, Fedora, and Proxmox
    Linux (pve), I'm a strong believer that Ubuntu users are fake Linux users. I'm also interested in drones but unfortunately crashed and lost mine and haven't gotten a new one yet.<br> <br>


    I am somewhat of a PC gamer as well, I just don't find myself playing games too often because of time. I like open-world, crime, and driving games mostly. I have a large collection of Nintendo
    games and systems, mostly every home console since the GameCube and every handheld since the DS, with the best consoles being the Wii(U), Switch(2), and 3DS. <br> <br> Thanks for checking my site
    out! Make sure to view the other tabs if you are interested in anything specific I mentioned here.
